# BYUCodeChallenge
I am currently overseas with nothing but a macbook, so I created a windows executable file using mingw-w64 from homebrew, but don't have a good way of testing it.
I also included my main file.
I used CLion, and included IOStream and map, nothing else.
I have some comments in my code showing my thinking process, resources and notes, any unused code, and how different portions of the code work.

I spent about 30 minutes brainstorming / creating the skeleton of my file, and then another 2 hours finalizing the math and the code.
I spent 36 minutes attempting to create a way to reject unrecognized roman characters, but realized it would take too long.
That was the end of my coding process, a little over 3 hours. 

After that, it took me almost an hour to upload everything to GitHub, along with downloading homebrew and using mingw-w64 to upload a windows .exe file.
My wifi is slow so the longest part was the downloading. 

Please email me at alexanderdavidatkinson@gmail.com if you have any questions, thank you for your consideration.
